                    /// Instead, I set the keyboard types in the text field and text view cells to email, because the email keyboard lines up nicely with the punctuation requirements for user input labels â€” normal double quotes ("") are disallowed, but almost all other punctuation is allowed.
                    
                    #warning("It may eventually be a good idea to trim punctuations from the ends of the labels. Emails, phone numbers, etc. would still be okay, but punctuation at the end of sentences would be stripped. HOWEVER, while stylistically preferable, stripping punctuation may interfere with readability. For instance, if a button says Give It a Try? and the UIL says Give It A Try, it might appear incongruent.")
