**The User Input Label Maker:** A small app for teaching developers best practices for writing Voice Control User Input Labels.

The app generates copy-pastable `.accessibilityUserInputLabels` from text provided by a developer. After generating a couple of label arrays, the user should have a better understanding of how easy it is to support Voice Control at a basic level.

The app also includes a "Tips" section that summarizes many best practices, with the idea that this section should be updated over time to reflect changes in Voice Control and user expectations.
