**The User Input Label Maker:** A small app for teaching developers best practices for writing Voice Control User Input Labels.

The app generates copy-pastable `.accessibilityUserInputLabels` from text provided by a developer. After generating a couple of label arrays, the user should have a better understanding of how easy it is to support Voice Control at a basic level.

The app also includes a "Tips" section that summarizes many best practices, with the idea that this section should be updated over time to reflect changes in Voice Control and user expectations.

Please feel free to contact me with any suggestions, corrections, or ideas!
